This folder should contain all of the domain specific files needed to run the NAMO domain.

In our case this should specify:

   -- A solver that subclasses AbsSolver to solve abstract problems
   -- A solver that subclasses LLSolver to solve concrete problems
   -- A domain file that specifies actions and predicates
   -- A problem file that specifies objects, an initial state, and a goal
   -- python files to support these definitions
