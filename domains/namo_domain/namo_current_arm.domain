# The first set of parentheses after the colon contains the
# parameters. The second contains preconditions and the third contains
# effects. This split between preconditions and effects is only used
# for task planning purposes. Our system treats all predicates
# similarly, using the numbers at the end, which specify active
# timesteps during which each predicate must hold
