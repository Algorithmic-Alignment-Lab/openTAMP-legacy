TODO Dylan: 
HI PRI
 - predicate resampling
 - swap task integration test
 - error propogation

LOW PRI
 - fix bug with grasp, need to have trajectory that allows robot to move into contact with object (for now just hacked to have safety distance 0)
 - hunt down bug with FF plan returning incorrect HL plan
 - fix ll_solver assumptions about pose and ind_arr
 - implement 'initialize near plan' (priority 0 solve)


DONE
 - putaway task
 - place object
 - check plan validity, get failed predicates, get first failed ind
 - update plans to explicitly track which attributes are fixed by the high level

 

IFNEEDBE
create IsMP constraint for robot (if needed), 

TODO Simon: 
HI PRI
   - unit tests for Stationary, StationaryNEq

LOW PRI
   - dymamics integration in state
   - dynamics integration in get_param_vector
   - dynamics integration in ll_solver


After IROS
 - fix modularity issues with sco.expr.py
